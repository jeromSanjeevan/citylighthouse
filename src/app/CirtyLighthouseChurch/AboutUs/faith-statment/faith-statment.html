    <h3>Statement of Faith <span class="subheading"> - WE BELIEVE</span></h3>
 
    <p>In the spiritual unity and priesthood of all believers in Christ and that these comprise of the universal church and body of Christ which is commissioned to preach the gospel to the world.</p>
    <p>That the Gospel embraces the needs of the whole man and that the church is therefore commissioned to fulfil a ministry of divine healing.</p>
    <p>That the Godhead exists coequally and coeternally in three persons, Father, Son and Holy Spirit and that the three are one in God, sovereign in creation, providence and redemption.</p>
    <p>In the deity of the Holy Spirit and the necessity of His work in repentance, regeneration and Sanctification; and that the believer is promised an enduement of power through the baptism in the Holy Spirit with signs following.</p>
    <p>In the ministries that Christ has set in His church, namely, apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors and teachers and in the present operation of the gifts of the Holy Spirit.</p>
    <p>In the personal, physical and visible return of the Lord Jesus Christ to reign in power and glory.</p>
    <p>In the universal sinfulness and guilt of human nature since the fall, rendering man subject to God’s wrath and condemnation.</p>
    <p>In the necessity of repentance towards God and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ by which the sinner is pardoned and accepted as righteous in God’s sight, this justification being imputed because of the righteousness and atoning work of Christ and received by faith alone.</p>
    <p>In the baptism of believers immersion in water and the commemoration of Christ’s death by the observance of the Lord’s supper until He returns.</p>
    <p>In the resurrection of the dead and the final judgement of the world, the eternal conscious bliss of the righteous and the eternal conscious punishment of the wicked.</p>
